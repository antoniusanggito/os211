# Top 10 List of Week 03

1. [File System Windows & Linux](https://dhanz3rd.wordpress.com/2010/12/14/file-system-di-windows-dan-linux/)  
   Blog in bahasa explaining very well File System in Linux and Windows. In Windows you will most likely see NTFS or FAT in harddisk properties. Meanwhile on Linux there are many types of Ext file system and its interesting to learn how it had improved along the way.

2. [FUSE Explained](https://fsgeek.ca/2019/06/18/fuse-file-systems-in-user-space/)  
    A brief explanation of FUSE (File Systems in User Space). This gives a general idea of what it actually is as an interface and how it works.

3. [Disk Partitioning Guide](https://linuxnewbieguide.org/overview-of-chapters/more-advanced-guides/partitioning-a-disk/)  
    A rough guide on partitioning disk to install Linux. Some options are explained well including choosing between primary or logical, partition type, etc. It gives better understanding on what we were doing when we installed debian on virtualbox weeks ago.

4. [Dual Boot](https://www.howtogeek.com/187789/dual-booting-explained-how-you-can-have-multiple-operating-systems-on-your-computer/)  
    How dual boot actually works? Operating systems is generally installed on internal hard drive. Having multiple hard drives or even within a single hard drive (with partition) you can install other operating systems, but of course when booting up you should only select one to run through BIOS.

5. [Dual Boot vs Virtual Machines](https://medium.com/@MKGOfficial/virtual-machine-vs-dual-boot-everything-you-need-to-know-5549fa11e9a)  
    Arises the question of what is the difference between the two? I personally have tried both and agree that it obviously depends on what you want to do with it, only for some simple things or a full on projects. But notice both disadvantages as explained in this article.

6. [Why do we need to mount?](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/178077/why-do-we-need-to-mount-on-linux)  
    This forum thread answers this question thoroughly. Basically operating system needs to know how to access files on the device we want to use. You can't just cd into the new device and work on it directly, that's why you mount it first to kind of register it.

7. [Does File Extension Matter?](https://askubuntu.com/questions/803434/do-file-extensions-have-any-purpose-for-the-operating-system)  
    Linux apparently doesn't rely on extensions when working on files. It determines the file type by examining the first few bytes or header of its content. For the most part extension is only a way to help human classify different files easily.

8. [Difference between GZIP and TAR](http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/difference-between-gzip-and-tar/)  
    We oftentimes see .tar.gz as an extension in files on linux. In short Tar is an archiver that combines multiple files into one, but Gzip is a compression tool to reduce disk space used. You apparently can do one of them instead of forced to do both using zip/rar files on Windows.

9. [Linux Commands Cheat Sheet](https://www.linuxtrainingacademy.com/linux-commands-cheat-sheet/)  
    Handy list of commands that can be used to know more about your Linux device including system information, hardware information, performance monitoring and statistics, user information and management, and many more.

10. [Bad Sectors on Hard Drives](https://www.howtogeek.com/173463/bad-sectors-explained-why-hard-drives-get-bad-sectors-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/)  
    Interesting information to know about the term bad sectors. Essentially it's a tiny cluster of storage that appears to be defective. It can cause data loss and corruption, so this article is pretty helpful.
