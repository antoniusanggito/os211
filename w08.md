# Top 10 List of Week 08

1. [Process States](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/operating-system-processes)  
   A very important topic in my opinion in learning about process and scheduling. It gives a whole bigger view of when scheduling really takes place between these whole process works after divided into sections.

2. [Overview of Scheduling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DhFmL-6SDA)  
   This is quite an interactive video explaining about scheduling especially preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling. I'm sure you can learn some basics here as it's pretty easy to follow.

3. [Types of Scheduler](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-process-schedulers)  
   After knowing some basics of scheduling, in process management we learn that there are three types of scheduler long, short, and medium term scheduler. Each one has its name aliases and is very well explained of what it does here.

4. [Parameters: Burst Time, Arrival Time, Exit Time, etc.](https://afteracademy.com/blog/what-is-burst-arrival-exit-response-waiting-turnaround-time-and-throughput)  
   These are common terms as parameters to measure performance of a system when dealing with CPU scheduling. This article is actually very helpful and informative in explaining each term even with some examples to make it easier to understand.

5. [Paper: Comparing Average Waiting Time of Scheduling Algorithms](https://osf.io/preprints/inarxiv/6dq3p)  
   An interesting paper analyzing and comparing average waiting time between FCFS, SJF, and Round Robin algorithm. The conclusion based on this paper is FCFS is better for a small burst time, SJF if process comes simultaneously, and Round Robin is better to adjust average waiting time desired.

6. [Linux vs Windows CPU Scheduling](https://www.ukessays.com/essays/information-systems/compare-cpu-scheduling-of-linux-and-windows.php)  
   This is an interesting topic for me as a main user of Windows but also currently learning Linux. Comparison table shown here is very detailed, comparing both OS one to one in about 15 aspects about scheduling.

7. [Advantages-Disadvantages of Scheduling Algorithms](https://www.studytonight.com/operating-system/comparision-scheduling-algorithms)  
   This website pinpoints advantages and disadvantages of each scheduling algorithms very nicely. It also explains specific situations on which to use which algorithm. It makes things clearer to understand for me.

8. [What is Dispatcher?](https://educatech.in/explain-dispatcher-in-operating-system/)  
   Dispatcher is a special program that works after scheduler completes selecting a process, it takes that process to desired state/queue. For more information this web gives simple but thorough explanation.

9. [Real Time Operating System](https://www.guru99.com/real-time-operating-system.html)  
   Not exactly things about scheduling, but I find this interesting as it explains very thoroughly about what RTOS is, its components, its type, etc. The next link will cover about scheduling in these real time systems.

10. [Scheduling in Real Time Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/scheduling-in-real-time-systems/)  
   After learning about real time systems, I got to this point of curiousity about how scheduling works in it. This website gives some approaches of scheduling algorithms used in real time systems.
