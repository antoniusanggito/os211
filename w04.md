# Top 10 List of Week 04

1. [How C is created](https://www.quora.com/How-was-the-C-programming-language-created)  
   One of some forum threads I found that answers this question. C as one of the oldest programming language is still used quite popularly even in modern days. Historically, C was developed mainly for UNIX and was inspirated by BCPL language. More to know here.

2. [Mapping Virtual Addresses](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mapping-virtual-addresses-to-physical-addresses/)  
   Address binding is the process of mapping from one address space to another address space. This article explains how virutal addressing works, from logical address we already know to physical address on memory.

3. [C Input/Output](https://www.studytonight.com/c/c-input-output-function.php#)  
   As one of the lower level language amongst other modern languages, there are many options on how you can do input and output. Quite interesting to know what are available.

4. [Why Computer Uses Hexadecimal?](https://medium.com/@savas/why-do-we-use-hexadecimal-d6d80b56f026)  
   A simple question to ask, but this answer can't be more reasonable. Readability and high information density is obviously one of the reason, but there is more to know from this article which is really interesting.

5. [Checking Your Linux Endianness](https://serverfault.com/questions/163487/how-to-tell-if-a-linux-system-is-big-endian-or-little-endian)  
   Just a simple search that I find interesting that includes linux command to know is the system big endian or little endian. Even there is a short python command for it!

6. [Why C Uses Pointers?](http://duramecho.com/ComputerInformation/WhyCPointers.html)  
   Pointer is a variable containing the address of another variable. C was developed back then to generally optimize a program to run faster or use less memory, it can be on arrays, strings, etc.

7. [C Library Functions Tutorial](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming/library-function)  
   Found this user friendly and modern looking C library tutorial. It explains pretty well what functions available and how to utilize them. This is one of the reason why C is still usable right now.

8. [Reverse Engineering Explained](https://searchsoftwarequality.techtarget.com/definition/reverse-engineering)  
   What reverse engineernig actually means in computer science? Basically it's away to reconstruct how a program works from its finished form. As far as I know this term is oftentimes used to understand complicated logics from a program.

9. [Decompiling with Ghidra](https://www.retroreversing.com/intro-decompiling-with-ghidra)  
   There is a free software to decompile an executable into C program in order to learn how it works, and it's Ghidra! I think it is an interesting software that I already used sometimes when I was learning CTF back then.

10. [Avoiding Exploitation](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/software-security/avoiding-exploitation-93BNx)  
   Informative video about common exploit that could happen, especially in C. Some of the vulnerabilities are canary, buffer overflow, format string, and some outdated methods like gets() and many more.
